# Diabetes Indicators Analysis
The goal of this project was to explore and answer research questions through insights regarding diabetes indicators using Python to analyze survey data.
  
**The following research questions were explored:**

1. Can survey questions from the data in this project provide accurate predictions of whether an individual has diabetes?
2. What risk factors are most predictive of diabetes risk?
3. Can we use a subset of the risk factors to accurately predict whether an individual has diabetes?
4. Can we create a short form of questions from the datasets in this task using feature selection to accurately predict if someone might have diabetes or is at high risk of diabetes, based on the analysis one will conduct?

## The Data

The data was obtained through survey questions and gathered into four datasets:
  
1. **demographic_data.csv**` - Contains demographic data per each person
2. **id_label.csv** - This file contains the label for this dataset
3. **health_measures.csv** - Contains relevant health measures per each person
4. **enriched_data.csv** - Extra data gathered per each person and contains few more measures

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis includes exploration steps done in SQL and visualization in Tableau (link provided in the Notebook file). Originally, the analysis was performed in a Datacamp workspace which allowed for SQL integrations to be run within the same notebook.
